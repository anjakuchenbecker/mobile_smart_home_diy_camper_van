/**************************************************************************************
Example sketch that illustrates the driving of a 1.8 inch SPI ST7735 TFT Display 128 x 160 Pixel.
In scope is also the programmatic activation and deactivation of the TFT backlight.

Inspired by https://github.com/olikraus/ucglib/wiki/connectst7735
I'm using the following display: https://www.az-delivery.de/products/1-8-zoll-spi-tft-display
