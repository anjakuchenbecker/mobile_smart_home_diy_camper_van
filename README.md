# "Mobile Smart Home" for our DIY Camper Van
With this repo I provide my concepts and some code snippets about our DIY camper van that I will turn into a "Mobile Smart Home" with an Arduino Mega and a bunch of electronic components.
Besides the Arduino Mega I plan in addition to install a Raspberry PI with a nice touch screen which communicates with the Arduino Mega.
